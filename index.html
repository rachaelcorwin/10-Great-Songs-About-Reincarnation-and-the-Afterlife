I danced myself out of the womb<br />
Is it strange to dance so soon<br />
I danced myself into the tomb<br />
But when again once more<br />
I danced myself out of the womb<br />
Is it strange to dance so soon<br />
I danced myself out of the womb</p>

There's just somethin' 'bout you I know,<br />
Started centuries ago, though.<br />
See, your kiss is like a lost ghost,<br />
Only I would know.</p>

<p>But, I, I keep on fallin' for you,<br />
Time after time, time after time.<br />
I'll make you mine, time after, time after time.</p>

Would you know my name<br />
If I saw you in heaven?<br />
Would it be the same<br />
If I saw you in heaven?<br />
I must be strong<br />
And carry on<br />
'Cause I know I don't belong<br />
Here in heaven</p>

Falls through without you.<br />

Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream,<br />
My only master.</p>

I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.<br />
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,<br />

Buddha and Moses and all the noses<br />
From narrow to flat<br />
Had to stand in the line<br />
Just to glimpse the divine<br />
What’cha think about that?<br />
Well, it seems like our fate<br />
To suffer and wait for the knowledge we seek<br />
It’s all His design<br />
No one cuts in the line<br />
No one here likes a sneak</p>

I thought this light would comfort me<br />

But there's a tugging at my sleeve<br />
So much baggage I brought with me to leave</p>

<p>Something so big I can't understand from trying to I would go mad<br />
So I hurry back to little earth for another life, another birth</p>

<p>Another life another birth</p>

<p>Mother?</p>

<p> Written by: David Byrne, Jerry Harrison<br />
Album: Fear of Music 1979<br />

There is a party, everyone is there<br />
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time<br />
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all<br />
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun<br />
Heaven, Heaven is a place, place where nothing, nothing ever happens<br />
Heaven, Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens</p>

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride<br />
With sword and pistol by my side<br />
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade<br />
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade<br />
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five<br />
But I am still alive.</p>

If I had ever been here before<br />
I would probably know just what to do, don't you?<br />
If I had ever been here before on another time around the wheel<br />
I would probably know just how to deal with all of you<br />
